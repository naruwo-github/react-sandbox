# Overview

This is a web application that simply displays React components.

Its main feature is that it defines only the HTML that serves as the rendering target for React components, while delegating the actual rendering process to an external package.

The package that composes the actual UI can be found [here](https://github.com/naruwo-github/sample-npm-package/blob/main/README.md).
